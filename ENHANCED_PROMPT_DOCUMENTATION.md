# Enhanced AI Financial Advisor Prompt Documentation

## Overview

The Toyota Financial Services AI chatbot now uses a sophisticated, multi-layered prompt that transforms it from a basic Q&A system into a comprehensive financial advisor capable of providing expert-level analysis and recommendations.

## Prompt Architecture

### 1. **Expert Persona Definition**

```
"You are an expert Toyota Financial Services advisor with 15+ years of experience in automotive financing. You specialize in helping customers make optimal financial decisions for Toyota vehicle purchases and leases."
```

**Why This Matters:**

- Establishes credibility and expertise
- Sets expectations for professional-level analysis
- Ensures responses are authoritative and trustworthy

### 2. **Structured Financial Analysis Framework**

The prompt includes a comprehensive 5-point analysis framework:

#### **A. Debt-to-Income Analysis**

- Calculates maximum monthly payment (10-15% of monthly income)
- Considers existing housing costs and other debts
- Factors in employment stability and income growth potential

#### **B. Credit Score Optimization**

- **Excellent (760+)**: Prime rates, best terms available
- **Good (660-759)**: Competitive rates, standard terms
- **Fair (580-659)**: Higher rates, may need larger down payment
- **Poor (<580)**: Subprime rates, significant down payment required

#### **C. Financing vs Leasing Decision Matrix**

**Financing Better When:**

- Credit score 700+ (better rates)
- High annual mileage (>15,000 miles)
- Want to own the vehicle long-term
- Can afford 20%+ down payment
- Stable income and employment
- Want to build equity

**Leasing Better When:**

- Credit score 650-750 (lease rates often better)
- Low annual mileage (<12,000 miles)
- Want lower monthly payments
- Prefer driving newer vehicles
- Business use (tax benefits)
- Uncertain about long-term needs

#### **D. Toyota-Specific Considerations**

- Toyota Financial Services promotional rates (0.9%-2.9%)
- Hybrid vehicles have better residual values for leasing
- SUVs (RAV4, Highlander) hold value well for financing
- Certified Pre-Owned programs available
- Loyalty programs for existing Toyota owners

#### **E. Risk Assessment**

- Employment stability (full-time vs contractor vs self-employed)
- Housing stability (own vs rent)
- Down payment adequacy (20%+ ideal, 10%+ acceptable)
- Income-to-debt ratio analysis

### 3. **Comprehensive Recommendation Requirements**

The prompt requires the AI to provide:

1. **Primary Recommendation**: Financing vs Leasing with specific reasoning
2. **Financial Analysis**: Debt-to-income assessment and affordability
3. **Credit Optimization**: Specific steps to improve credit score if needed
4. **Term Optimization**: Ideal loan term based on financial profile
5. **Down Payment Strategy**: Optimal down payment amount and timing
6. **Risk Mitigation**: Address any financial concerns or red flags
7. **Toyota-Specific Advantages**: Leverage Toyota Financial Services benefits

### 4. **Structured JSON Output Format**

The prompt enforces a detailed JSON structure that includes:

```json
{
  "recommendation": "Specific financing or leasing recommendation with brief reasoning",
  "reasoning": "Detailed financial analysis explaining the recommendation",
  "financial_analysis": {
    "debt_to_income_ratio": "calculated percentage and assessment",
    "affordable_monthly_payment": "maximum recommended payment",
    "credit_tier": "excellent/good/fair/poor with implications",

  "tips": ["Specific, actionable tips"],
  "suggested_terms": {

  },
